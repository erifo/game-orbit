# "Orbit"
### About
Student project from 2016 about game creation using SDL2 in C++.

Navigate a bubble, which is continuously orbiting around your cursor, through a maze of spikes.

By manually orbiting your cursor around the bubble at proper length and speed, the bubble can be made standstill to pass through smaller passages.
